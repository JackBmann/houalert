HOUalert

HOUalert is an Android and Web app that conglomerates all current emergency, weather, and public works data into one map. Using the ESRI mapping system, we layered 311, police, fire, weather, and hurricane data onto a single map.

I worked primarily on the Android app and researched the ESRI GIS system which the City of Houston uses for their data.
